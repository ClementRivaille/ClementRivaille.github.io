    <h2>Creations</h2>
    
    <h3>Games</h3>
    <p>I've started game development in 2016. I'm making short games, mostly for the web. Some have been made during 48 hours jams. You cn find the entire list of them on <a href="https://itooh.itch.io">itch.io</a></p>

    <ul>
      <li v-for="game in games">
        <project-link v-bind="game"></project-link>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Experiments</h3>
    <p>These are personal creations made to test or learn various technologies.</p>

    <ul>
      <li v-for="experiment in experiments">
        <project-link v-bind="experiment"></project-link>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Videos (French)</h3>
    <p>In 2015, I started making videos for Youtube. At the time it was mostly experimental: I tried doing sketches, essays, game analysisâ€¦ With a schedule of one video per week, my goal was to learn this medium and explore what I could do. Some of the results are bad, some are absolutely terrible, and a few are actually still pretty okay.</p>
    <p>In 2017, I decided to focus myself on game-design videos. Since I've been doing essays about independant games, strange creations, and original usages of the game medium. My goal is to bring reflexions on how we define video-game, show how it can be used in new and creative ways, and share thoughts on some unknown games.</p>
    <p>As stated, those videoas are only in French. They can be seen on the channel <a>Excursions Virtuelles</a>.</p>
