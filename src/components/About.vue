  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Front-End developer specialized in JS frameworks such as AngularJS, React and Vue. I'm interested in integration, ergonomics and accessibility, as well as communication. My goal is to build bridges between designers and developpers, by understanding challenges and constraints of both sides. Developping UX is as well an exciting field for its evolving technologies and paradigms, one that forces empathy toward users, and finally allows to work with various profiles going from back-end developers to artists.</p>
  <p>
    I also develop games on my spare time. They are mostly experimental, narrative and contemplative. It's a great way to experiment with technologies, notably the Web Audio API. They also encourage me to create non utilitarian projects, using technologies only for entertainment, art, and in the end making them more human. Games are the ideal media to combine my developpers skills with some of my hobbies, such as writing, composing, and maybe acting on some occasions!
